# The era of high interest

## To begin
Ignore all the factors and background infos and all the macro theories relative to how we get high interest rate. Questions come up when this high interest rate is about to sustain.
Interest rate is the price of capital. If the economy is good enough, the price of capital will be more expensive than before. So there comes countless new questions, 
what industry what kind of job will become a better choice?  
The price of capital can influence a lot of thing. In microeconomics, the alternative of capital -- labor have to be more to meet the need due to less capital. 
The need of labor is quite obvious now ,as the cpi in service industries is still high and the labor cost is still quite expensive.

To analyze this question, given I dont have a solid and comprehensive analyzing framework, the eaziest method is to analyze it through different angels.

Then places with low labor cost can earn money, for example the developing countries in Southern-east Asia. Those countries can sell labor for higher prices and there exists huge demand.
The labor in developed countries are alse facing *the larger need for labor to substitude for capital*. 
- It has to be confirmed that why the labor need is so low as the Federal tampering while a lot of big enterprise anounce massive layoff. Those are not compatible.

It need some macro framework.
